# Lair

this project serves as an abstraction and management layer above neovim, intended for taking and organising notes.
the intention being, I take a lot of notes, and I don't often consider where to save them - or sensible names.
I will have a meeting, and save my lengthy messy notes under Architecture_meeting_notes.md in whatever directory I was in last. Dreadful. I know.

This is a rust TUI, intended to present a framework in which you can open a new note, write it using nvim, and have it be saved to a central location.
